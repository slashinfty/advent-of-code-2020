Some lessons and things I've learned:

* `.reduce()` is great at performing operations on arrays
* It might not be as readable, but you can add `true` and `false` as 1 and 0
* If you want to copy an array to manipulate, be sure to create a new array (like `[...array]`)
* Classes and recursion can be used for nesting problems in a pinch
* Loops in loops? Use references to determine what to `break` from
